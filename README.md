In this project, I try setting up Vite and ESLint + Prettier.

### What I love about Vite

- Fast HMR: With this project, I get the dev server ready in literally 1s.
- Auto restart dev server on config change: With Next.js, when change content of its config file, I have to manually restart server. This's not the case with Vite.
- Unlike CRA where most of the things are configured out of the box (which's good if you want to focus on coding), Vite comes with minimal stuffs, and you add what you need.
